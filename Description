1. Introduction

Early detection of kidney-related diseases is crucial for preventing long-term complications, especially in diabetic patients. This project focuses on building a machine learning–based classification model that predicts the likelihood of kidney disease using various urine analysis parameters such as gravity, pH, osmolarity, conductivity, urea, calcium levels, and more.

The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and predictive model development, helping understand which urine biomarkers contribute most to disease detection.

2. Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following columns:

gravity

ph

osmo (Osmolarity)

cond (Conductivity)

urea

calc (Calcium)

sugar

target (0 = Healthy, 1 = Kidney-related condition)

An id column was present initially but removed since it does not contribute to prediction.

3. Data Preprocessing

Key preprocessing steps performed:

Removing non-useful columns (like id)

Checking for missing values

Ensuring all feature columns are numeric

Normalizing and cleaning the dataset for modelling

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook includes:

a) Distribution plots

Histogram and distribution graphs for each variable to study their range and behavior.

b) Scatterplot Matrix

Used to understand relationships between features.

c) Box and Swarm Plots

These plots highlight how each feature varies between healthy and disease classes.

d) Target Imbalance Check

The dataset contains mild class imbalance, which could influence model performance.

e) Correlation Heatmap

A correlation matrix is used to identify which features influence the target strongly.

5. Feature Engineering

To improve prediction quality, additional features were engineered:

Specific Gravity to Calcium Ratio

Urea to Osmolarity Ratio

Estimated Urine Volume using a derived formula

Additional medically meaningful transformations to amplify predictive power.

These engineered features were later analyzed for correlation and importance.

6. Feature Selection

A Random Forest Classifier was trained to extract feature importance rankings.
Features were sorted by importance, and the top contributors were shortlisted for the final model.

This step ensures:

Reduced overfitting

Simpler model

Better generalization

7. Model Training

The project focuses on building models such as:

Random Forest Classifier

The model is trained on selected features, allowing it to predict whether a patient is likely to have a kidney-related condition.

8. Results

Feature importances were computed successfully.

Key urine parameters strongly correlating with disease were identified.

Feature engineering improved model interpretability and performance.

The final model can be further deployed to real-world systems for early kidney disease screening, especially in diabetic patients.

9. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can assist in medical diagnosis using simple lab test values. By analyzing urine biomarkers and engineered features, the model helps identify high-risk patients early. Such predictive models are extremely valuable in hospitals and diagnostic centers for preventive healthcare.

10. Future Scope

Deploying as a FastAPI / Flask web app

Integrating with hospital management systems

Adding more biomarkers for higher accuracy

Testing the model on a larger, more diverse population
